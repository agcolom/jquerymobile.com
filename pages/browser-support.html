<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

<p>jQuery Mobile has broad support for the vast majority of all modern desktop, smartphone, tablet, and e-reader platforms. In addition, feature phones and older browsers are supported because of our progressive enhancement approach. We're very proud of our commitment to universal accessibility through our broad support for all popular platforms.</p>
